            <p class="">
                "Abule" is a Yoruba word for Village. So, welcome to my village, the Niger Delta. The Niger Delta is the delta of the Niger River sitting directly on the Gulf of Guinea on the Atlantic Ocean in Nigeria. 
                It is typically considered to be located within nine coastal southern Nigerian states, which include: all six states from the South South geopolitical zone, one state (Ondo) from South West geopolitical zone and two states (Abia and Imo) from South East geopolitical zone. 
                Of all the states that the region covers, only Cross River is not an oil-producing state. 
                The Niger Delta is a very densely populated region sometimes called the Oil Rivers because it was once a major producer of palm oil. 
                The area was the British Oil Rivers Protectorate from 1885 until 1893, when it was expanded and became the Niger Coast Protectorate.
                The Niger Delta region of Nigeria is richly endowed with both renewable and non-renewable natural resources. 
                It contains 20 billion of Africa's proven 66 billion barrels of oil reserves and more than 3 trillion cubic meters of gas reserves. 
                The delta is a petroleum-rich region and has been the center of international concern over pollution that has resulted principally from major oil spills of multinational corporations of the petroleum industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Niger Delta, as now defined officially by the Nigerian government, extends over about 70,000 km2 (27,000 sq mi) and makes up 7.5% of Nigeria's land mass. 
                Historically and cartographically, it consists of present-day Bayelsa, Delta, and Rivers States. 
                In 2000, however, Obasanjo's regime included Abia, Akwa-Ibom, Cross River State, Edo, Imo and Ondo States in the region.
                The Niger Delta, and the South South geopolitical zone (which contains six of the states in Niger Delta) are two different entities. 
                The Niger Delta separates the Bight of Benin from the Bight of Bonny within the larger Gulf of Guinea.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some 31 million people of more than 40 ethnic groups including the Bini, Itsekiri, Efik, Esan, Ibibio, 
                Annang, Oron, Ijaw, Igbo, Isoko, Urhobo, Kalabari, Yoruba, Okrika, Ogoni, Epie-Atissa people and Obolo people, 
                are among the inhabitants of the political Niger Delta, speaking about 250 different dialects.
                Language groups spoken in the Niger Delta include the Ijaw languages, Itsekiri language,
                Central Delta languages, Edoid languages, Yoruboid Languages, and Igboid languages.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a research caried out by Vivienne Bamgboye (Lead Researcher), Peter Shiras (IYF Executive Vice
                President), Dan Oliver, PhD (IYF Business Development Director) Micah Mendie (PIND Analysis & Advocacy
                Program Coordinator), the Niger Delta generates nearly 80% of Nigeria’s revenue, yet the majority of the population there
                remains in dire poverty and the region has been beset by violent conflict. Current development efforts
                and assistance recognizes that much more effort is needed to improve socio-economic conditions in
                the region if its problems are to be sustainably overcome. No single organization can address these
                problems on its own and thus the best solutions lie in the establishment of effective multi-stakeholder
                partnerships.

                <h2>Our Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    From the research conducted by Vivienne Bamgboye (Lead Researcher), 
                    Peter Shiras (IYF Executive Vice President), Dan Oliver, PhD 
                    (IYF Business Development Director) Micah Mendie (PIND Analysis & 
                    Advocacy Program Coordinator),
                    the majority of youth participants – who were primarily either
                    students or unemployed youth (with a very low percentage of
                    youth in paid employment), although the assessment did
                    include some semi-literate, informal sector workers (such as
                    street vendors or motorcycle delivery vendors) – when asked
                    to state their aspirations, said, “…just to survive.” In Port
                    Harcourt, Bori, and Bayelsa, young people told the
                    assessment team that they try to occupy their time with
                    positive activities such as educational seminars or church
                    activities. There were strong indicators that the youth in urban
                    areas, such as Port Harcourt, Warri, Benin, and Asaba, were
                    trying to “take charge of their lives” by engaging in casual work
                    to earn small amounts of money. During the focus groups in
                    Port Harcourt, most participants also said they did casual work
                    to supplement their income as their families could barely afford
                    to maintain their own costs. Female participants commonly responded 
                    that they worked in hairdressing salons or tailoring shops for small 
                    salaries. Some participants admitted that they engaged in illegal 
                    activities “to survive” because these activities “bring in more money”. 
                    Illegal activities mentioned include petty theft, Internet fraud, 
                    and selling stolen properties.
                </p>
                <p>These circumstances are brought upon the general populace of the 
                    Niger Delta as a result of the following;
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Corruption.</li>
                    <li>Militancy.</li>
